### Selinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for LinuxÂ® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.

### What is Sepolicy?

When an application or process, known as a subject, makes a request to access an object, like a file, SELinux checks with an access vector cache (AVC), where permissions are cached for subjects and objects.

If SELinux is unable to make a decision about access based on the cached permissions, it sends the request to the security server. The security server checks for the security context of the app or process and the file. Security context is applied from the SELinux policy database. Permission is then granted or denied. 

If permission is denied, an "avc: denied" message will be available in /var/log.messages.

## Handling the Selinux errors:

If there is an selinux error, we can address them using the following,

1. Wrong labels: Your labeling may be incorrect, use audit2allow to fix the labels.
2. Need to fix policies: This is to inform you have made or might need to adjust a policy.
3. Bug in policy: A bug which need to be addressed.
4. **Check for neverallows**: System might not allow certain policies at build time. Handle them at system spolicies.

```

### AVC Rules

AVC rules are the control privileges that are allowed for processes.
The four AV rules are 

- allow
- dontaudit
- auditallow
- neverallow

The general syntax of the AV rule can be given as:

```
`rule_name source_type target_type:class perm_set;`
```


### allow

The allow rule checks whether the operations between the source_type and target_type are allowed for the class and permissions defined.

### dontaudit

The dontaudit rule stops the auditing of denial messages as it is known that this event always happens and does not cause any real issues. This also helps to manage the audit log by excluding known events.

### auditallow

Audit the event as a record as it is useful for auditing purposes. Note that this rule only audits the event, it still requires the allow rule to grant permission.

### neverallow

This rule specifies that an allow rule must not be generated for the operation, even if it has been previously allowed.
